MLST
===================

Multi-Locus Sequence Typing


Documentation
=============

The MLST service contains one python script *mlst.py* which is the script of the lates
version of the MLST service. The method enables investigators to determine the ST based on WGS data.

## Content of the repository
1. mlst.py      - the program
2. test     	- test folder
3. README.md
4. Dockerfile   - dockerfile for building the mlst docker container


## Installation

Setting up MLST program
```bash
# Go to wanted location for mlst
cd /path/to/some/dir
# Clone and enter the mlst directory
git clone https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/mlst.git
cd mlst
```

Build Docker container
```bash
# Build container
docker build -t mlst .
# Run test
docker run --rm -it \
       --entrypoint=/test/test.sh mlst
```

#Download and install MLST database
```bash
# Go to the directory where you want to store the mlst database
cd /path/to/some/dir
# Clone database from git repository (develop branch)
git clone https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/mlst_db.git
cd mlst_db
MLST_DB=$(pwd)
# Install MLST database with executable kma_index program
python3 INSTALL.py kma_index
```

If kma_index has not bin install please install kma_index from the kma repository:
https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/kma

## Dependencies
In order to run the program without using docker, Python 3.5 (or newer) should be installed along with the following versions of the modules (or newer).

#### Modules
- cgecore 1.5.5
- tabulate 0.7.7

Modules can be installed using the following command. Here, the installation of the module cgecore is used as an example:
```bash
pip3 install cgecore
```
#### KMA and BLAST
Additionally KMA and BLAST version 2.8.1 or newer should be installed.
The newest versions of KMA and BLAST can be installed from here:
```url
https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/kma
```

```url
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/
```

## Usage

The program can be invoked with the -h option to get help and more information of the service.
Run Docker container


```bash
# Run mlst container
docker run --rm -it \
       -v $MLST_DB:/database \
       -v $(pwd):/workdir \
       mlst -i [INPUTFILE] -o . -s [SPECIES] [-x] [-st]
```

When running the docker file you have to mount 2 directory:
 1. mlst_db (MLST database) downloaded from bitbucket
 2. An output/input folder from where the input file can be reached and an output files can be saved.
Here we mount the current working directory (using $pwd) and use this as the output directory,
the input file should be reachable from this directory as well.

-i INPUTFILE   input file (fasta or fastq) relative to pwd.

-s SPECIES 	species origin of input file.

-o OUTDIR	outpur directory relative to pwd.

-x 		extended output. Will create an extented output.

-st     save temp_folder. Will save the temporary folder.

## Web-server

A webserver implementing the methods is available at the [CGE website](http://www.genomicepidemiology.org/) and can be found here:
